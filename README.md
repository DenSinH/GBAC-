# GBAC-
After the wild success of the NES emulator I'm going to attempt to make a GBA emulator

Done:
  - ARM instructions
  - THUMB instructions
  - Render mode 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (, 5?)
  - SWI's
  - Some IRQ handling (ohhh boy was this annoying)
  - DMA
  - Timers
  
To do:
  - fix stuff (IRQs mainly)
  - some background stuff doesn't always display properly...
  - alpha blending / windowing
  - sound
  - Other registers
