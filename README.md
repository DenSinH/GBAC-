# GBAC-
After the wild success of the NES emulator I'm going to attempt to make a GBA emulator

Done:
  - ARM instructions
  - THUMB instructions
  - Render mode 0, 3, 4, 5 (?)
  - SWI's
  - Some IRQ handling (ohhh boy was this annoying)
  
Todo:
  - Render mode 2, 3
  - DMA
  - Timers
  - Other registers
