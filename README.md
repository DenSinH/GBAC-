# GBAC-
After the wild success of the NES emulator I'm going to attempt to make a GBA emulator

Done:
  - ARM instructions
  - THUMB instructions
  - Render mode 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (, 5?)
  - SWI's
  - Most IRQ handling (ohhh boy was this annoying)
  - DMA (seems to be a small problem with this still)
  - Timers (though still pretty inacurrate)
  - Windowing
  
To do:
  - fix stuff
  - alpha blending
  - sound
  - Other registers
  - open bus
  - more accurate cycles
  - OBJs and windowing in BM rendering modes
